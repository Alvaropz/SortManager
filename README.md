## General Info:
This project will use the Bubble and Merge Sort logic to sort an array of 40 random integers. This array can contain duplicates.

   * Write a program that will take an array of `ints` and sort it using a **bubble** sort algorithm and then a **merge** sort algorithm.
   * Include **JUnit** tests for this and all subsequent phases.
2. Phase Two:
   * Work in progress...
3. Phase Three:
   * Work in progress...
4. Phase Four:
   * Work in progress...
6. Phase Five:
