## General Info:
This project will use the Bubble and Merge Sort logic to sort an array of 40 random integers. This array can contain duplicates.
1. Phase One:
   * Write a program that will take an array of `ints` and sort it using a **bubble** sort algorithm and then a **merge** sort algorithm.
   * Include **JUnit** tests for this and all subsequent phases. Code passing tests in phase 1? &#9745;
2. Phase Two:
   * Project updated following the MVC design pattern. Code passing tests in phase 2? &#9745;
3. Phase Three:
   * Project updated to track and log classes and methods.
4. Phase Four:
   * Integrates a Binary Search Tree class that sorts elements form an unsorted list into the tree. Then, it retrieves an array of that Binary Tree sorted. Code passing tests in phase 4? &#9745;
6. Phase Five:
   * Timing information added. This allows to compare algorithms performance.
